# Scissors Paper Rock (JS PRACTICE)
## A little weekend project to practice javascript. First time coding a project without following any tutorial and trying to figure things out myself. It was a great experience :) 

1. First Challenge: Trying to change the player image while left and right button is clicked.
2. Second Challenge: Figuring out how to determine the winner.
3. Third Challenge: Figuring out the scoring system.
